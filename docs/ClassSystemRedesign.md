# Class System Redesign for SoniScript

This document describes the reimplementation of the class handling system in SoniScript.

## Overview

The new class system provides a more unified and extensible approach to handling classes in SoniScript. It addresses several issues with the previous implementation:

1. Duplication of class information across multiple components
2. Potential for inconsistency between different systems
3. Limited inheritance support
4. Difficulty in testing due to singleton pattern

## Key Components

### UnifiedClassContainer

The core of the new system is the `UnifiedClassContainer` class, which:

- Manages class definitions, properties, methods, and inheritance
- Provides methods to register and query class information
- Handles static properties
- Supports inheritance properly

### ClassFactory

The `ClassFactory` provides functionality for creating and managing class instances:

- Creates instances of classes with proper initialization
- Handles method calls on instances
- Manages property access and modification
- Supports type checking with `isInstanceOf`

### ClassRegistry

The `ClassRegistry` serves as the main interface for working with classes:

- Provides a unified interface for registering classes
- Creates instances
- Manages static and instance properties
- Handles method calls

### ClassContainerAdapter

The `ClassContainerAdapter` provides backward compatibility with the existing code:

- Implements the `ClassContainer` interface
- Delegates operations to the new system
- Allows for a gradual migration without breaking existing code

## Migration Plan

To migrate from the old class system to the new one:

1. Use the `ClassContainerAdapter` to automatically redirect existing code to the new system
2. For new code, use the `ClassRegistry` directly
3. For manual migration of specific classes, use the `ClassMigration` utilities

## Benefits of the New System

1. **Better organization**: The class information is unified in a single place.
2. **Improved inheritance**: Better support for inheritance with proper method and property resolution.
3. **Extensibility**: The system is more extensible and can be adapted to new requirements.
4. **Testability**: The components can be tested independently.
5. **Clear interfaces**: The interfaces are clearer and better documented.

## Example Usage

See the `examples/class_system_example.cpp` file for detailed examples of how to use the new class system, including:

- Defining classes
- Creating instances
- Working with properties and methods
- Implementing inheritance

## Testing

The new system includes comprehensive tests in `tests/ClassContainerTests.cpp`, covering:

- Basic operations on the `UnifiedClassContainer`
- `ClassFactory` operations
- `ClassRegistry` operations
- Backward compatibility with `ClassContainerAdapter`
- Migration utilities

## Future Enhancements

Possible future enhancements to the class system:

1. Support for interfaces
2. Multiple inheritance
3. Abstract classes
4. Method overloading
5. Better support for native methods with reflection

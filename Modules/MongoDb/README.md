# MongoDBModule

This module provides comprehensive MongoDB database functionality via the official MongoDB C++ driver (mongocxx) in VoidScript, offering modern document-based database operations.

## Overview

The MongoDBModule supports:

1. **Connection Management**: Establish and manage connections to MongoDB instances
2. **Document Operations**: CRUD operations on MongoDB collections
3. **Query Support**: Advanced querying with BSON filters
4. **Index Management**: Collection indexing and performance optimization
5. **Aggregation Pipeline**: Advanced data processing pipelines

## Features

- Full CRUD operations for MongoDB collections
- Connection pooling and health monitoring
- BSON document handling with VoidScript objects
- GridFS support for large file storage
- Transaction support (when using MongoDB 4.0+)
- Collection and database management
- Aggregation pipeline operations

## Usage

Currently in stub phase - implementation details will follow in subsequent tasks.

## Integration

Ensure the `MongoDBModule` is registered before running scripts:

```cpp
Modules::ModuleManager::instance().addModule(
    std::make_unique<Modules::MongoDBModule>()
);
Modules::ModuleManager::instance().registerAll();
```

## Testing

Test scripts will be available in the `test_scripts/` directory once implementation is complete.
